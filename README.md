# 3d_reconstruct
Tutorial on using mobile camera to reconstruct 3D based on 2D images.

Following the tutorial [here](https://medium.com/@omar.ps16/stereo-3d-reconstruction-with-opencv-using-an-iphone-camera-part-iii-95460d3eddf0) that again is based on this [openCV tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.4/d9/db7/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_calib3d.html).

[This lecture](https://ags.cs.uni-kl.de/fileadmin/inf_ags/3dcv-ws14-15/3DCV_lec01_camera.pdf) by Prof. Didier Stricker is also relevant to skim through. The following slide present 3D reconstruction in four mayor steps;

1) getting images, 2) getting their poses, 3) 3D reconstruction and 4) Texturing.
